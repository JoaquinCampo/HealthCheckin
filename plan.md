Heck yes—let’s plan the build, step-by-step, no code yet. Think of this as your engineering “tickets” list.

0) High-level flow

User taps Refresh → app reads Health → aggregates → builds JSON v1 → shows it.
Optional: user taps Summarize → JSON → OpenAI → short daily brief.

1) Project structure (modules)

Domain: metric enums, units, JSON v1 contract, validation rules.

Health: permissions, queries, aggregation, baselines, outliers.

Storage: anchors, cached JSON, settings (feature flags).

AI: prompt builder, OpenAI client, response schema.

UI: one main screen (Status, JSON viewer, Summary), Settings sheet.

2) Permissions UX

First launch sheet: what we read & why with toggles for HRV, RHR, Sleep, RespRate, Temp, Steps, Energy, Workouts.

Then system Health permissions dialog.

If any type denied, keep JSON keys with null + add flags.

3) Data scope (v1)

Night (sleep-bounded last night):

HRV (SDNN ms), Resting HR (bpm), Respiratory rate (br/min), Sleeping wrist temp Δ (°C), Sleep (start/end, duration, stage minutes).
Day (today):

Steps, Active energy (kcal), Workouts (type, start/end, duration, avg/max HR).

4) Aggregation design

Sleep windows: get .asleep segments for last night; merge contiguous; produce window start/end.

Time-weighted means inside sleep windows for HRV/RHR/Resp/Temp.

Daily aggregates for steps & energy (local day).

Workouts: include last 24h; map to friendly types (Padel, Run, Strength).

Baselines:

7-day EMA for HRV, RHR, sleep duration.

30-day mean & std → compute delta_vs_30d and z_score_30d.

Outliers: apply caps (HRV <5 or >250 → flagged), RHR <30 or >120 → flagged, Temp |Δ|>2.0 → flagged.

5) Incremental sync

One anchor per type (HRV, RHR, Resp, Temp, Sleep, Steps, Energy, Workouts).

On app open or Refresh:

run anchored queries,

re-aggregate last 3 days (handles late writes),

build new JSON,

cache JSON + anchors.

6) Error & quality model

Each metric result carries: sample_count, source/device (if available), quality: [] (e.g., ["missing_data","outlier_capped"]).

Top-level flags: missing_hrv, low_sleep_confidence, no_watch_pairing, permissions_partial.

7) JSON v1 contract (frozen)

Top-level keys: meta, windows, readiness_signals, activity, flags.
Include timezone and UTC offsets; stick to ms, bpm, br/min, kcal, minutes.
(You already have an example—keep that as the canonical fixture.)

8) UI plan (single screen)

Status bar: Last updated time, permissions state pills (✅/⚠️).

Actions: Refresh, Copy JSON, Share JSON, Summarize (OpenAI).

JSON viewer: monospace, pretty-printed, expandable sections (optional).

Summary card (appears after OpenAI): 3 lines + readiness color (Green/Amber/Red) + 2 bullet deltas.

9) OpenAI integration (later toggle)

Prompt builder: deterministic; consumes only JSON v1.

Response contract: { readiness: "green|amber|red", headline: string, deltas: [..], suggestions: [..] }.

Caching: store response keyed by sha256(JSON).

Privacy: confirmation sheet shows the exact JSON before sending.

10) Settings (minimal)

Timezone display (read-only), units (metric fixed), “Auto-send to OpenAI on Refresh” (default off).

Reset anchors/cache.

11) Testing plan

Happy path: full permissions, real Watch night → non-empty JSON.

Partial permissions: deny temp/resp → keys are null, flags set, no crash.

No sleep night: Aggregation falls back; low_sleep_confidence = true.

Clock change / travel: verify offsets in windows.

Outliers: inject extreme values → quality includes outlier_capped.

Baseline warmup: first week shows null 30-day stats gracefully.

12) Milestones (what to build in order)

Scaffold & permissions (button shows granted/denied per type).

Sleep window & nightly aggregates (HRV, RHR, Resp, Temp).

Daily activity aggregates (steps, energy, workouts).

Baselines (7-day EMA, 30-day mean/std).

JSON assembly + validation (pretty print, copy/share).

Anchors + re-aggregate last 3 days.

UI polish (status, flags, errors).

OpenAI summary (opt-in flow, cached).

Background delivery (nice-to-have later).

13) Acceptance criteria per milestone

2: Night window computed matches Health app times ±5 min; per-metric sample_count > 0.

3: Steps/energy equal Health app’s “Today” totals ±2%.

4: EMA/mean/std stable across app relaunches.

5: JSON validates against your fixture; copy/share works.

6: Second launch fetches only new samples (anchor advances).

8: Same JSON → same summary (idempotent); new JSON → new summary.
