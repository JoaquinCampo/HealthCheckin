Here’s a clear, detailed explanation of what we’re building and why—end-to-end, no code.

1) Vision (what this app is)

A personal iOS app that:

Collects key Apple Health signals automatically.

Aggregates them into a clean, self-contained JSON for “last night” + “today”.

(Optionally) Sends that JSON to OpenAI to get a brief, actionable daily summary.
Everything runs on your phone; no one else uses it.

2) Outcome (what success looks like)

On opening, you tap Refresh and see a valid JSON blob showing:

Nightly recovery signals (HRV, Resting HR, Resp. Rate, Wrist Temp Δ, Sleep).

Today’s activity (steps, active energy, workouts).

Baselines (7-day EMA, 30-day mean/std) and deltas vs. baseline.

Provenance (source, sample counts) and quality flags.

If you tap Summarize, you get a 3-line briefing (readiness color + 2 deltas + 1 suggestion).

Data is private by default; sending to OpenAI is explicitly opt-in each time (or via a toggle you control).

3) Scope (what data we include)

Night (bounded by sleep intervals):

HRV (SDNN, ms), Resting HR (bpm), Respiratory rate (br/min), Sleeping wrist temperature delta (°C), Sleep total & stages + sleep/wake timestamps.

Day (calendar day):

Steps (count), Active energy (kcal), Workouts (type, start/end, duration, avg/max HR).

4) Aggregation rules (how values are computed)

Sleep windows: use HealthKit sleepAnalysis to get .asleep segments and merge them into a single night window; this bounds “recovery” metrics.

Time-weighted means: compute HRV/RHR/Resp/Temp only within sleep; weight by each sample’s duration.

Daily activity: sum steps & active energy for local day; include workouts from the last 24h with basic stats.

Baselines: compute locally:

7-day EMA for short-term trend.

30-day mean & std for stability; report delta_vs_30d and z_score_30d.

Outliers: cap and flag obviously wrong values (e.g., HRV <5 or >250 ms).

5) JSON v1 (what we output)

Top-level keys: meta, windows, readiness_signals, activity, flags.

Meta: generation time (UTC), timezone + offset, app version.

Windows: night_start, night_end, day (ISO8601).

Readiness signals: each metric has value, sample_count, baseline_7d_ema, baseline_30d_mean/std, delta_vs_30d, z_score_30d (where relevant), source, quality[].

Activity: steps, active_energy_kcal, workouts[].

Flags: missing_hrv, low_sleep_confidence, permissions_partial, etc.
The JSON is stable (contract won’t change unexpectedly) so the OpenAI prompt stays reliable.

6) UX (what the user sees)

Single screen:

Status row: last updated time + small permission/quality pills.

Buttons: Refresh, Copy JSON, Share JSON, Summarize.

A scrollable, pretty-printed JSON viewer.

After Summarize: a compact summary card (Green/Amber/Red + 2 deltas + 1 tip).

First-run sheet: “What we read & why” → then iOS Health permissions dialog.

7) Privacy model (non-negotiables)

All processing is on device.

No uploads by default.

When sending to OpenAI: show the exact JSON being sent; require an explicit tap (or a settings toggle you control).

No third-party SDKs; only Apple frameworks + your code.

8) Architecture (how it’s organized)

Domain: JSON models, units, validators.

Health: permissions, queries, anchored sync, aggregation, baseline math, outlier rules.

Storage: anchors (for incremental sync), cached JSON, settings.

AI: prompt builder, OpenAI client, response schema & caching (by hash(JSON)).

UI: SwiftUI views (status, actions, JSON viewer, summary card).

9) Data freshness (how it stays up to date)

Use HKAnchoredObjectQuery per data type to fetch only new samples.

On each refresh, re-aggregate the last 3 days (handles late-arriving sleep/HRV).

Cache latest JSON so the app opens instantly offline.

10) Non-goals (what we are not doing now)

No App Store release, accounts, or servers.

No editing Health data.

No complex charts or multi-user features.

No ML onboard—OpenAI is optional and external.

11) Milestones (build order)

Permissions & skeleton UI (buttons + empty JSON).

Sleep window + nightly aggregates (HRV/RHR/Resp/Temp).

Daily activity aggregates (steps/energy/workouts).

Baselines + deltas + flags; assemble JSON v1; pretty-print & share.

Anchors + re-aggregate last 3 days (incremental sync).

OpenAI: prompt → summary card; cache by JSON hash.

Polish: status pills, error messages, settings toggle for auto-send.

12) Acceptance criteria (when each part is “done”)

JSON validates against the contract and includes timezone/units.

Numbers match Health app totals within reasonable tolerance.

Missing permissions produce null values and flags (no crashes).

Reopen app → only new samples fetched; JSON changes when it should.

Same JSON → same summary (deterministic); new JSON → new summary.

That’s the full shape of the project. If you want, I can turn this into a task board checklist (copy-pasteable) so you can track progress step by step.
